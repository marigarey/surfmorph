For my Advance Morphology Fall 2025 | Paper-UnPaper Assignment

## Proposal One
Using the Unimorph English Dataset, train different models and see whether Sentence Transformer can better split a word by its morphemes.

### Libraries
1. SentenceTransformer
2. Torch DataLoader

## Sources
* [Dataset from UniMorph](https://unimorph.github.io/)


* inventory of existing words
* order language
* idosyncrasies (filters ?)

morphology tells us what is the possible words

## Proposal Two
Created my own CNN to detect and predict parts of speech of words!

### Notes
* All of this is located in the jupiter notebook (nn.ipynb)
* I am still playing around with this section and it is more fun to me lol
