For my Advance Morphology Fall 2025 | Paper-UnPaper Assignment

## Proposal
Compare different models's ability to predict the part of speech for English and possibly a low resource language. additionally, there will be comparisons between different Libraries

### Libraries
1. sklearn
2. tensorflow
3. pytorch
4. perpetual boosting
5. Howso
6. Natural Language ToolKit
7. Gensim
8. SpaCy
9. HuggingFace Transformers

### Models
1. Stochastic Gradient Descent
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Nearest Neighbors
4. Gaussian Processes

## Sources
* [Dataset from UniMorph](https://unimorph.github.io/)


* inventory of existing words
* order language
* idosyncrasies (filters ?)

morphology tells us what is the possible words
